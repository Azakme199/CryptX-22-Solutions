http://ctf.prastuti.in/

## Rules

* Round 2 will begin on 15 April at 10:00 pm and end on 16 April at 10:00 pm. 24 hours duration.
* Register on the CTF Platform before-hand using the email used in the Round 1.
* You are free to use any tool.
* Top 5 participants may be asked for the write-ups (editorial). So, document your solutions with you.
* All the Flags are case-sensitive. So, make sure you submit what you actually get, without changing cases, unless stated otherwise.
* In questions where it is mentioned "Submit the flag obtained", you will automatically get the answer in the flag format **cryptX{th1s_i5_4_fla9}** on solving correctly.
* In question where it is mentioned like Submit the flag after wrapping it in cryptX{}. You will not get the flag in the format. But, there will be something like either you have to submit the entire text or there might be some text in plaintext like XYZ is the flag or following is the flag or some sort of indication will surely be there.
